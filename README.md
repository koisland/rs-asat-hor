# rs-asat-hor
Library for parsing and iterating through alpha-satellite higher-order repeats.

### Why?
* All HOR stv code is string-y.
* Edge cases.
* Nothing able to go from stv to monomers.

### TODO
* Python binding.
* Iterator friendly.
* Forward and reverse from HOR to monomers.
* Documentation
* stv script
